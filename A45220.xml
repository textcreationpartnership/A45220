            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In a word, <hi>David</hi> a man well acquainted with his own

Politiquely contriving the ſpeedieſt &amp; ſureſt way of
accompliſhing their ſecular, and worldly deſignes, then was
<hi>David</hi> lighting his candle, <hi>i. e.</hi> his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at the
Lamp of God: then was he ſearching the darke receſſes, and deep vaults of
that heart which he knew was profound to deviſe and do wickedly. And now, one
would think that ſuch diligent ſearch ſhould leave nothing
undiſcovered, and that a man after this might ſay, that there was no guile
in his heart, but his eye ſaw it &amp; watched over it; But however a bold:
and ignorant foule might poſſibly ſo thinke, and ſay; yet
<hi>David</hi> dareth not thinke, nor ſay ſo, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this
diſtruſting his owne heart (which he knew too well to truſt it much) he
brings it to God the ſearcher of hearts, and tryer of Reines with earneſt
ſuits that he would deliver him from his guilefull heart, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
139. <hi>v.</hi> 23,24. <hi>Search mee O God, and know my heart, try mee, and

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56472:15"/>earneſtneſſe, five times together he prayeth that God
would diſcover himſelfe, his heart to himſelfe, and deliver himſelfe
from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for after all this diligence he is jealous there is, he
knoweth poſſibly there may be, ſome what of this guile, and hypocriſie.
And now having heard ſuch witneſſes, what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need have wee?
Chriſtian, doth not thy ſoule heare it ſelfe confeſſing this truth?
Say, if it be ſo difficult for <hi>David,</hi> a man enlightned, by the

                  <p>So that in briefe, the ſinfulneſſe of the frame or
diſpoſition of the heart of man with theſe perſons, is no more then an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy temperature of the Elements, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the body, and ſwaying the
mind according to their prevalency. Now who ever did, or juſtly could
apprehend much ſinfulneſſe in this, that our bodies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of
the Elements, or that ſuch or ſuch a temperature doth moſt prevaile?
whoever thought it an exceeding great ſin that he was of a Sanguine
Complexion? or <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56472:24"/>how much blame worthineſſe is there in a
Phlegmatick Conſtitution? barely as ſuch. I know the different tempers do
different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promote and further ſin, do much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the workings of
this ſin: but this is an effect <hi>ex accidenti,</hi> no direct naturall
effect of this or that conſtitution, but it is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that ſin which
dwells in us, and which obſerving that the temper of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth ſway us
more one way, then other, taketh hold of that advantage, and worketh powerfully
by this conſtitution, to the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of the ſinner on to ſin. In the
mean time, while they thus put all upon their Genius, and reſolved this into
the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Elements, they muſt be thought to have had no right
knowledge of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfulneſſe of their heart propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and
inclining to ſin: but I dwell too long with theſe perſons, who might be
men of choiceſt naturall parts, but wanted the beſt Improvement; being
without the Church, and ſo without the externall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and helpes,
which might heighten their reaſon to a clear and full diſcovery of this:
but did not Beſt improved naturall men within the Church ordinarily, or at
leaſt might they not (by the improvement <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56472:25"/>of Reaſon and
parts, though they remained unregenerate, and naturall men) have come to a
ſight of this ſinfull frame of heart in its great ſinfullneſſe? well,
view we, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Phariſees (and conſider what may be judged, and
ought to be anſwered to this) choiceſt men for learning and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before Chriſt his comming in the fleſh; yet they took a view of this
ſinfull frame with a falſe glaſſe, which repreſented ſcarce the one
halfe of this body of ſin, and what was ſo repreſented was varniſht
over with colours of their own mixing, that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not what it was, but
what they would have it be: as is evident from their corrupt expoſition of
the Law, which our Lord notes and condemnes in the 5<hi>th. ch. of
Matthew.</hi> They ſaw not the ſinfulneſſe of a malitious heart, or of
a heart ready to boile with cauſleſte anger: witneſſe their groſſe
corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting that precept, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> either ſaying it
was a prohibition of murthering an Iſraelite, or that only murther which was
done <hi>prepriâ manu.</hi> Heare what they ſay in their Talmud,
(<hi>as I find it in</hi> Dr. Lightfoot's <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader of his
Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the New Teſtament.</hi>) <hi>A murtherer is he that kills his
neighbour with a ſtone, or <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56472:25"/>with Iron, or thruſts him
into water or fine, out of which it is impoſſible to get our againe, he is
guilty: but if he thruſt him into fire, or water, out of which it is
poſſible to get out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though he die, yet is he quit. If he ſets a
dog or a ſerpent on him, he is quit</hi> &amp;c. of like nature with this.
And now can you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe generations of men to know the
ſinfulneſſe of a murtherous frame of heart, who ſo fouly miſtated the
externall act, and acquitted that as no murther, which is one of the higheſt
degrees of it? will you ſay that the man knowes, or believes any
ſinfulneſſe in a bloody revengefull diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? who can ſay
<hi>That he who hireth another to kill his neighbour, or ſends his
ſervants, and they kill him</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is Guilty as a blood-ſhedder,
to be puniſhed by the hand of heaven onely,</hi> not by man? yet this was
ordinarily a received doctrine among them, as appeares by what is farther added
by <hi>Dr. Lightfoot</hi> in the forecited place. Their <hi>Expoſitions</hi>
of the reſt of the Law are much of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Actuall externall
uncleanneſſe, and defiling their neighbours wife they thought to be a
ſin, but never accounted the habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bent, and propenſion of the heart
to this, to be a ſin, or forbidden in that Law. They <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56472:26"/>were
not troubled at the thoughts of any ſecret reluctancy to the holy commands of
God: It was nothing with them to have natures full of

to ſee of it, unleſſe when God brought him to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome kind or
other for his ſinne, then he ſeeth more of it indeed: but let him be quiet,
and ſecure from the hand of the Almighty, and hee ſeeth no more then he is
willing to ſee of it. <hi>Hell hereafter, and puniſhment now, will convince
a ſinner, and make him looke on ſinne,</hi> and ſee ſomewhat more then
he could deſire to ſee in it: but in the caſe before us, in an ordinary
enquiry after ſinne, in order to detect it, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a right
knowledge of it; His ſight of ſinne is never greater then his
willingneſſe: Nor will be ever ſee more then he deſires to ſee of it:
if the ſpirit of renovation power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully change the ſinner, and make him a
Saint, it will change this frame of heart, and make him earneſtly deſirous,
and truly willing to ſee his ſinne, and to have a full, and cleare ſight
of it: The ſinner who is enamoured with, and eſpouſed to his ſinne,
will deale <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56472:54"/>well with his Beloved in the ſearch, as
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> did with <hi>David,</hi> when her father ſent to apprehend
him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.16,17. when a meſſenger from God in his Word, or
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is ſent to ſearch for the beloved luſt of a ſinner, then
'tis either ſick, (as one that needs not now be feared it is dying) or if
this ſerve not, but the luſt muſt be brought out, and ſo endangered:
then 'tis conveyed away, and ſecured from the ſtroke of the word and rod,
Naturall men will deny the abode of their ſinne, as <hi>Rahab</hi> the Spies:
And they have a deepe and darke well to hide their luſt in when it is
enquired after, as the woman had to hide <hi>Jonath:</hi> and <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.21. and Bread-corne to ſpread over it, a faire pretence,
that, what (we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) is a ſinfull luſt and working to ſinne, is
but a neceſſary proviſion for the life, and welfare of the man.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the Scripture onely tell us that men are thus ſelfe
admirers, and unwilling to appeare to themſelves in any cloud which might

ſoule:</hi> For this doubt muſt be anſwered, not by <hi>Denying</hi>
theſe men to have any or but little knowledge of this ſinne; I thinke I
ſhould manifeſtly injure the truth, and be unjuſt to their memory, and
unthankfull to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who have written for the truth in this

deny them to be knowing men, and well ſtudied in theſe Queſtions. <hi>An
ſit? Quid ſit? Quale &amp; unde ſit,</hi> &amp;c. which they are able to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine according to truth, and defend when they have determined it. And for
ought I know in this they may go farther then ſome enlightned ſanctified
foules, who have not the helps of ſo much learning, or ſuch acute judgments
and Inſight into controverſies. But yet for all this there is a vaſt
difference between theſe two know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the one may be termed, and will one
day appear to be an <hi>Ignorant knowledge,</hi> (pardon the expreſſion) a
knowledge, and <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56472:58"/>yet as good as no knowledge, when the
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge will appear the onely right, and true knowledge: and at
preſent we may obſerve a great deale of difference in theſe, as</p>
               <div n="1" type="difference">
                  <head>1. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Regenerate ſoule is a ſpirituall

                  <p>1. The Knowledge of a regenerate ſoule is a <hi>ſpirituall

be a more wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things and things, perſons and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
then that which is thus founded in what is ſpirituall and its oppoſite, and
ſuch is the difference in theſe two ſorts of men, one doth ſee the
ſpirituall wickedneſſe of this ſin, the contrariety that is in it to a
ſpirituall Law, to ſpirituall obedience, to the ſpirituall manner of
performing it. The other ſeeth the unreaſonable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this
ſinfull nature, the contrariety and incongruity of ſuch a frame of heart to
refined Reaſon; Reaſon tells the man that there is but one God, that he is
only to be worſhipped: hence he diſcovers how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to reaſon it
is to have more, or worſhip more Gods: the ſpirituall regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſoule
ſees the ſpirituall as well as the unreaſonable wickedneſſe of ſuch
Idolatry <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56472:59"/>&amp;c. the like may be ſaid of all the
commands of the law, which have both a <hi>conformity to reaſon</hi> (all
God's precepts are highly rationall) <hi>and to that which is higher then now
reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nis,</hi> and which the
Scripture calleth ſpirituall. All the precepts are of a ſpirituall nature.
Now the learned unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man compareth this frame of the heart with that
part of the Law which is thus proportioned to reaſon, and ſeeth how far
this frame is diſſonant to it, and concludes it ſo far out of order; it
is reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable he ſeeth, that the law which is juſt, and ſhould rule
the whole man, ſhould alſo bind the whole man to be readily diſpoſed,
and duly framed to the obſervance of that Law, and if a part, or the whole
frame be not ſo diſpoſed, he concludes it Peccant and culpable. It is but
a reaſonable thing that the Law which is ſo juſt and good, ſhould be
uniformely obſerved, as well in the firſt forming of our thoughts, as in
the ultimate, and laſt perfecting of them, and ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes ſome unreaſonableneſſe in the
ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the firſt motions. In a word theſe Learned, Improved natural
men in this whole matter ſee nothing, but what is the object of their
<hi>reaſon,</hi> either to be approved, <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56472:59"/>or diſallowed,
The regenerate foule ſeeth and conſidereth, that this law is very
ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and meaſureth the ſinfulneſſe of his heart, and the
ſinfulneſſe of its firſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings by this law as ſpirituall, and
ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that there is a wickedneſſe in it, which is of a higher
nature then a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to Reaſon. As an Artiſt ſeeth the
excellency or the rarity of a diſcourſe which he heareth, or of an
experiment which he feeth, and accordingly judgeth the one conſonant to, the
other diſſonant from the naturall, regular, and certaine conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of
the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of his art; which
diſcourſe a man who is no artiſt heareth, and underſtandeth the
Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conſtruction of the whole, ſeeth the materialls of the
experiment, and the effect wrought, yet falls exceedingly ſhort of that
knowledge which the artiſt hath, and he gets but a Grammaticall knowledge, or
ſuch as his ſenſe (with which he perceived the experiment) can help him
to, while the Artiſt hath gotten a cleare, certaine, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall knowledge:
'tis not much unlike in this caſe, and as the objects of their knowledge thus
differ, ſo likewiſe the faculties, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or qualification
differeth, the one <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56472:60"/>knowing by common illumination, the
other by a ſpeciall and more then common illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſpirit: but I
will not inſiſt on this, it being for ought I know a matter which we cannot
ſo evidently and clearly ſtate, as to make of this any plaine
diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating note, by which we may cauſe others to ſee and
underſtand what the difference is. I know that there is ſuch a difference,
and that it is great; I know that one ſeeth with an eye enlightned by
eſpeciall light from the ſpirit, the other doth not, but I know it is not
eaſie to deſcribe theſe; and what might be gathered from the effects of
each, by which alone they can be diſcerned, will fall in my way, before I
have done with theſe particulars, therefore I ſay no more of this now. The
firſt difference is in the Generall laid down by the Apoſtle in that of 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. for the pardon of, and deliverance from this ſin, is one
of thoſe things which are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

underſtood by him only who hath the ſpirit of God, and being ſpirituall
compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſpiritualls with ſpiritualls. Who hath the ſpirit of the world
doth not ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, becauſe he cannot ſpiritually diſcerne
them. <hi>v.</hi> 14. And it is plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56472:60"/>intimated
to us by the Apoſtle in this very chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>I
know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Law is ſpirituall,</hi> though whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
I was carnall and judged carnally of the Law I thought of my ſelfe as
righteous, as blameleſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. becauſe I had not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of the ſtricteſt outward obſervance of the command, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5.
yet now I ſee the law is ſpirituall and ſo there is a ſpirituall
obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due which I carnall could not give and in defect of this obedience
there is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickedneſſe which while I was a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee
(though learned and as much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as any) I did not ſee; Thus St
<hi>Paul</hi> and the experience of every Saint will confirme to us, how great
a difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſight and knowledge he now hath, and that
he once had of ſinne as it is contrary to the Spirituall Law of God.</p>

is perſwaded it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him, ſo long as he liveth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will contentedly permit it to live. The regenerate man doth perfectly hate it,
and makes that very reaſon one incitement to more perfect hatred of it, which
the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate would have accounted a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repreſſe, or
abate his hatred. Indeed here is ſeen the moſt abſolute and
irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable hatred, which a created <hi>Being</hi> can exert on juſt
grounds, becauſe it doth ſo ſoon defile our perſons, and ſo ſoon
render us unfit, and unworthy of communion with <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56472:68"/>God, who
is our life; ſo ſoon rob us of our onely treaſure, make us beggars ſo
ſoon as men, therefore we in reaſon ought to hate it, and the ſanctified
ſoule doth abhorre it. Becauſe it ſo cloſely adheres to us, that
whither ſo ever we go, it is our trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome attendant, which we cannot
ſhift our ſelves of, its company is moſt unwelcome to us, yet moſt
unavoidable: and this moves our Indignation againſt it, becauſe it is ſo
inſeparable from all we undertake and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in for performance of our Duty,
and ſervice due to our God; becauſe what we moſt heartily wiſh we
could, that we moſt certainly find we ſhall not be rid of; becauſe in our
beſt performances, when we are beſt prepared for them, and hope to be
imployed without much diſturbance from this enemy to all good, becauſe then
we find it cannot be caſt off, it will not be ſo diſpoſſeſſed of
its hold, or ſuppreſſed in its actings, we do the more irreconcileably
hate it: for, theſe and ſuch like conſiderations heighten the regenerate
man's hatred of this ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Naturall improved man rather hence
reſolves not to trouble himſelfe for that he could not prevent, nor ſpend
his thoughts on that he cannot remove. He accounts it <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56472:69"/>ſcarce prudence to be troubled at that he cannot be handſomely
eaſed of; <hi>what cannot be cured muſt be endured.</hi> Juſt like a man
that will rather expreſſe a ſeeming welcome to a troubleſome gueſt,
then let him know he is a debtour for that only which could not be with holden
from him But now the frame and diſpoſition of a regenerate ſoule and his
behaviour is quite contrary, he hates the more for this inſeparable cloſe
adheſion of this ſin. This may be evidently ſeen in St <hi>Paul,
Rom.</hi> 7.15. who hated that which he did, and ſurely if he hated what he
had done, he could not do leſſe then hate that which had already, and
continually would, put him upon doing the ſame. When a man reflects on what
is done, and juſtly hateth it, he cannot but hate that perſon, thoſe
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors and counſells, which did deſignedly engage him to it, and will
farther prompt, and ſollicite him to do the like. If undutifull
<hi>Abſalom</hi> had lived to ſee the hatefulneſſe of his unnaturall

and obedience, he would doubtleſſe have hated both his former rebellion,
his counſellour <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and the abettours of it. So when a man
is renewed, &amp; through <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56472:69"/>Grace acquainted with, and
ſenſible of, his forepaſt rebellions againſt the Lord, when he is
reduced to the right diſpoſition of a Son and Dutifull child, he doth
entirely hate his former courſes, and eſpecially that which entangled him,
and ingaged him in them. The ſoule renewed to holineſſe, and received
into the favour of a ſon, begins to conſider the hatefulneſſe of that

or to condemne the ſinfulneſſe of it. The one rejoyceth that <hi>Sin</hi>
cannot rule without controule, the other wiſheth that there might be an
uninterrupted exercise of it's power in him. The unregenerate, though beſt
improved with naturall and morall helps, do boldly (though ſecretly) wiſh
there were no Law to forbid the ſin, or no juſtice to puniſh the
ſinner; if any of the Learned worldlings would ſpeak out their
obſervations of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which either they do, or might gather from the
workings of this ſin, we ſhould have them confeſſing this a truth.</p>
                  <p>The learned Atheiſt, reading the firſt Commandment,
ſeeth that as he ſhould have but only the true God for his God, and that he
ſhould onely love, delight, and ſerve him, not his owne luſts, will
ſooner be induced to wiſh there were not, or to flatter himſelfe, that
there is not a God, and that he is not ſo obliged to duty towards him. The
ſame might be obſerved in the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſtill the
unregenerate mans love is towards his naturall ſinfull inclinations, in 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56472:70"/>diſlike of the ſpirituall, holy and juſt Law of God.
But the Regenerate and renewed ſoule is well pleaſed, and in love with the
holy Commandment in oppoſition to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall luſts and corruptions:
Juſt like as it is with a chaſte wife and faithfull, ſo is it with a

alone which will diſappoint, it is ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that will befoole you, for
this onely at firſt did, this onely now doth, obſcure the mind, infatuate
the judgment, and delude poor miſtaken mortalls to the embraces of an empty
ſhaddow of knowledge. Believe it Sirs, for at laſt it will appeare, that
the largeſt extended knowledge of a ſinner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of ſin
(however he may boaſt of it, as the fruit of a long and diligent ſearch) is
but the longer ſhaddow of one, who lives in a vicinity to the Sphere, in
which the Sun of righteouſneſſe ſhines glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and enlightens
others, whileſt no more light ſhines on him, then ſerves to caſt the
ſhaddow, and this, becauſe his eſpouſed ſins keep him at a diſtance
from the true light. The farther we are from the Sun, the greater ſhaddow we
caſt, but the leſſer we ſee, ſo the more we are diſtant from God
ſhining on us in the face of Chriſt, The greater ſhaddow of knowledge we
may ſeem to caſt, but really we ſee ſo much the leſſe; our
knowledge is ſtill but a ſhaddow, darke, and vaine, onely fitted to 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56472:78"/>ſeduce, and make us loſe our waies, like a darke and
miſty day to a traveller; onely fitted to encreaſe our ſorrow and
vexation, like an empty ciſterne to a thirſty traveller in a tedious
drought and heat. If you'l be Scholars indeed, and know much, and if you'l know

it knows there is a contrariety in grace to ſin, to deſtroy it, 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56472:82"/>and therefore he oppoſeth it; as a man in a Phrenſy,
through the violence of a fever doth not know his need of ſuitable
applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to deſire them, yet may know the ſmart, trouble, and
bitterneſſe of the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to rage againſt them, and thruſt them
from him; or as we obſerve it in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more frequently, the knowledge of
that ſenſible unpleaſantneſſe which is in Phyſick maketh them
ſtrongly diſlike it, ſo the naturall man <hi>knowes by report ſo much
of the nature and working of grace, ſo much of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
unpleaſantneſſe to the fleſh, as to reject it, but he knowes not ſo
much of his own need, as to deſire it.</hi> Nor can the Naturall man raiſe
himſelfe to an eſteeme of Chriſt and Grace through him; which appeares

his need of Chriſt and grace. <hi>Need enhaunceth the price of every good and

de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it ſelfe with ſuch inſufficient ſearch; which relyeth on this
deceit, and finds the greatneſſe of it at laſt, when God diſcovers it
to him, that he is not fit for an undefiled inheritance who hath ſo defiled a
heart, and uncleane nature: be not deceived thou muſt be cleanſed or
eternally periſh, if thou wilt be cleanſed thou muſt know thy

who is known, either to have already diſcovered it, or that is known to have
skill ſo as to do it, if any can. When thou travelleſt, and needeſt a

to Chriſt, eſpecially now that thou art warned of it, and haſt heard this
reaſon given thee; thou heareſt, that they cannot ſee their need of
Chriſt with the beſt helpes of nature, and education, and therefore they
keepe off from him. But obſerve it, Who do more readily? more ſpeedily
cloſe with grace then theſe men when once they are enlightned and
ſavingly convinced? I think no men make more haſte to <hi>the city of

that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice purſues them, and when the conviction <pb n="169" facs="tcp:56472:92"/>is
ſet home, ſo that they have reall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of their dangsr; and
there is a good reaſon for this haſte they make before others viz:
Uſually they have clearer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincter, and deeper apprehenſions of their
ſtate, and condition then other men, and <hi>the cleerer and deeper our
apprehenſions are the ſpeedier our attempt will be to eſcape thoſe
dangers which we apprehend are likely to fall on us.</hi> Now there are two
things which do render theſe men's apprehenſions more cleare and diſtinct
viz:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Greater meaſure of light ſhining into the
underſtanding, and overpowring all its falſe lights which the man (proud
once of his parts) did before ſet up, for as a man who walk's by a weake, and
glimmering light would refuſe that light for his guide which another that was
wholy in darkneſſe and knew himſelfe ſo to be in the darke, would
readily embrace; ſo is it here, many that have great parts and abilities
ſhining in them like ſtarres, or comets in the night will put off that
weaker convincing light of the truth, which one who findeth himſelfe all
benighted rejoyceth to ſee though but a ſtarre, the leaſt degree of
light, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſoundly; whereas more and ſtronger 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56472:93"/>light is needfull to convince a learned ſinner throughly
and ſavingly. Hence it is that they ſo much differ in ſo little time in
their apprehenſions of impending danger, <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall learned man had
apprehenſions of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his ſoule, of the power of a God to
puniſh, of the great miſery and unhappineſſe, which the ſoule muſt
needs lie under, if this God proceed to puniſh: he can diſcourſe of the
inſupportable paine which Immateriall ſoules endure,</hi> this he can do
upon maximes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo that the man doth ſee ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
ſaving illumination of the ſpirit of God doth enlighten him with a better
light, but ſo ſoone as this ſhines in upon him, he doth with the
advantage which the other affords him, ſee much more of theſe things, and
his own danger: and accordingly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth his eſcape from it. Thus
acquired Improvements under a through worke of conviction haſten men from the
danger they were in. Againe</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Improved parts lie uſually in a ſoule that is
of larger and vaſter capacity, ſo that it ſooner receives much of
ſpirituall light, and hath larger and more extenſive appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of
the excellency of Grace and mercy in a Jeſus. And ſo upon through 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56472:93"/>Convictions flyeth more ſpeedily to Chriſt, and
riſeth higher in it's value of Chriſt. So that if you needs will eye, and
take example by learned men, then look on thoſe who are under a ſaving
worke of the ſpirit of God, and judge by their apprehenſions and value of
Grace <hi>Now,</hi> what will be the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and value which the
reſt ſo enlightned <hi>will have</hi> of the ſame grace: if you will
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to weigh Grace in the ſcales of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and improved men, then
borrow St: <hi>Paul's</hi> ſcales and weights, which be uſed after

the holyneſſe of his nature:</hi> what ever thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, be ſure to
take heed thy heart doe not grow hard, and inſenſible; leaſt it contract
a brawny and callous hardneſſe under ſinne, it muſt be a conſiderable
cut that bring's blood, or paineth a man in that part of his body which is much
hardned, whereas the leaſt ſcratch will draw blood, and bring griefe with
it to one who hath a tender cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. A hardned heart will not be ſenſible
of ſin, unleſſe it be ſome great one, which <pb n="193" facs="tcp:56472:104"/>wound's deep, and then perhaps it may be ſomewhat ſenſible of
it, but yet not duely affected with it.</p>

in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the croud of men, who call themſelves Chriſtians, ſee how they
differ in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſin, proportionably to their different degrees of
tenderneſſe of heart: Reall Saints under a defect of this have (and I
wonder not at it) fallen into a defect of judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the
greatneſſe of ſin, they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted that a little ſin, when their
hearts have been ſomewhat hardned which in a tender frame of ſpirit they
more rightly eſteemed a great ſinne. And obſerve it, as you have loſt
of your tenderneſſe, ſo your ſin hath loſt of it's heinouſneſſe
in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: recovered backſliders among Saints will beare me
witneſſe to this truth.</p>
                     <p>Tell me diddeſt thou rightly ſee the great
ſinfullneſſe of an earthly mind of a formall <pb n="194" facs="tcp:56472:105"/>and
hypocriticall heart, of a careleſſe and looſe heart, of a vaine and
fooliſhly wanton heart? Diddeſt thou not think there was leſſe evill in
them when thy heart was ſomewhat hard, and had loſt of it's wonted
tenderneſſe? How hath thy boldneſſe to ſinne, and thoughts that it
was but a little ſinne which thou art now about to commit, gotten ground on
thee upon ſuch a decay? time was, when thou who art a tradeſman ſaweſt
a great deale of ſinne in a lie, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to cheate, in a little too
much gaine; Time was when thou who art a Scholar ſaweſt a great deale of
ſinne in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending a day, or a few houres of thy time; what is now the
cauſe thou doeſt not ſo judg? Is the ſinne changed? Or is the Law
changed? No, but thou art changed, thou waſt then of a tender frame of
ſpirit, but now haſt loſt it, and thence it is thou ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgeſt:
once thou couldeſt not ſtep a ſtep in thoſe rough and thorny waies but
thou did'ſt bleed, and ſmart for it: why doeſt thou without ſenſe of
ſmart now runne long in them? is not this the cauſe? thou haſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
thy ſelfe in them, and canſt not ſee the evill of them. In a word our
ſight, and knowledg of the ſinfulneſſe of our nature, 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56472:105"/>is a knowledg of Spirituall ſenſe, and very much
reſemble's our knowledg which have by our bodily ſenſe in this, that due,
and juſt tenderneſſe is a very neceſſary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
diſpoſition of the organ to diſcerne the object; ſo let our

conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſpoſition in the faculty, and wee ſhall certainly judge
more rightly of it.</p>

ever came to a right knowledg of ſinne by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it, for it ſtill
appeareth other then what it is to him, who is unwilling to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it. As to the power, and ſtrength with which it worketh, and as to the
wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, policy wherein it contrive's it's works, it is more then evident,
that the beſt way to diſcover them is by oppoſeing our ſelves to them;
the encounter of an enemy is a meanes to draw forth his power, and craft which
had otherwiſe lay hidden. <hi>And it will appeare alſo a very ſuitable,
and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <pb n="196" facs="tcp:56472:106"/>way to diſcover both the
ſinfulneſſe and the guilt; the uncleaneſſe, and the danger of
ſinne,</hi> both in the <hi>branches</hi> and in the <hi>rootes</hi> of it by
a timely and vigorous oppoſition of it. <hi>For whileſt we oppoſe it</hi>
in the power of the ſpirit of God, and by the word which is holy and
directeth us in an oppoſition, <hi>there is an increaſe both of an
internall light in the mind, &amp; of an externall light in the word,</hi> the
one as the light of the eye which ſeeth the other as the light of the ſun
by which it ſeeth, the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and blackneſſe of ſinne. The
word and law enlighten the ſoule which before was in the darke, and blind;
and then the more the enlightened ſoule adheres to this word in oppoſition
to ſinne, the more it ſeeth of the purity of the word, and the
vileneſſe of ſin. There is in the word a native fitneſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this effect, and a kind of naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between theſe termes.
Contraries illuſtrate, and diſcloſe each other, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt wee lay
the word of God before us commanding one thing and our ſinfull hearts
ſuggeſting an other, ſinne becomes in our ſight exceedingly ſinfull,
ſo it did to <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Beſide this, God doth delight to
diſcover how ſinfull a naturall heart is to thoſe, who would really have
a deliverance <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56472:106"/>from it,</hi> and bleſſed them in this
oppoſition to this end; and farther, thy oppoſition to <hi>it will be a
meanes to take off the temptation to like and plead for that which thou
ſhould'ſt, but haſt not diſliked and oppoſed;</hi> and it is a
dangerous temptation to overlooke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of evill in that we have done
when it is done, ſince wee oppoſed it not when it was in doing; men would
faine be found not ſo guilty, where they are ſure to bee found ſomewhat
guilty. Thou wilt be the more willing to ſee the ſinfulneſſe of a
natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heart, when thou ſo oppoſeſt it, <hi>becauſe thy oppoſition
to it make's it ceaſe to be thine in a great meaſure, no more I, but ſin
that dwelleth in me,</hi> no more I, but Satan that take's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a
ſinfull heart, &amp;c. <hi>Thou</hi> who canſt oppoſe ſin vigorouſly,
and heartily, <hi>needeſt not be ſo much aſhamed of it, and thou wilt the
more certainly diſcover that fully which thou mayſt without ſhame,</hi>
when another will not (if he could) becauſe he cannot but with ſhame. But
why ſtay I on theſe? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who ever thou art that heareſt or

of thy heart propending to ſin ſo clearely, as thou haſt upon a victory
over it? preſently after a ſtrong oppoſition <pb n="198" facs="tcp:56472:107"/>to it?
In a word either thy reſiſtance hath foiled ſin, then on ſerious view
of it, with all its circumſtances, thou haſt ſeen what vileneſſe was
in it; or if thy reſiſtance hath failed of the ſucceſſe thou
deſiredſt, and thou haſt fallen, yet upon recovery thou haſt ſeen,

more of it at ſuch times, or ever ſo much, as when thy ſoule hath been
